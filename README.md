# Hacking101: Explore, Attack, Defend! üöÄ

Welcome to Hacking101, a project designed for learning and demonstrating simple hacks on a vulnerable web application.

## About ‚ÑπÔ∏è

This project contains a vulnerable web application (`vulnerable_webapp`) that simulates common security vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection and Cross Site Scripting (XSS). It also includes scripts and code files to perform specific attacks and demonstrate security concepts.

## Activities üõ†Ô∏è

1. **SQL Injection:** Explore how SQL Injection works and its impact on a web application's security.
2. **Cross Site Scripting (XSS):** Understand the dangers of XSS attacks and how to defend against them.
3. **Logical Error Bypass:** Python script (`store_1_logical.py`) for bypassing logical errors in code.
4. **Language-Specific Error Exploitation:** C++ code (`store_2_overflow.cpp`) demonstrating language-specific vulnerabilities.
5. **Command Injection via insecure function implementation:** Python script (`store_3_execute.py`) showcasing command injection via vulnerable function implementation.
